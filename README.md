# Gentleman.Dots

## Description

This repository contains customized configurations for a complete development environment, including Neovim, Fish, Zsh, **Nushell**, Tmux, Zellij, and terminal emulators like Alacritty, WezTerm, and Kitty. You can choose between automatic and manual installation methods depending on your preference and operating system. **Important:** Windows users must follow the manual installation instructions before running the script.

## Installation (Automatic Recommended!)

### The Easy Way! Test the automated process and let the script do all the work for you ðŸ˜˜

The **automatic installation script** is the quickest and easiest way to set up your development environment. This script handles all the heavy lifting, but remember that you **must install the font** mentioned below before running it. The script is designed for macOS, Linux, and WSL systems. If youâ€™re on Windows, youâ€™ll need to follow the manual steps first before attempting to run this script.

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gentleman-Programming/Gentleman.Dots/main/install-linux-mac.sh

sudo chmod +x install-linux-mac.sh
bash ./install-linux-mac.sh
```

## Manual Installation

Welcome to the Gentleman.Dots manual configuration guide! This document will walk you through the steps required to set up your development environment.

### For Windows

**Important:** Windows users must follow these manual installation steps before running the automated script.

#### 1. Install WSL

WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) allows you to run Linux on Windows. Install it and set it to version 2:

```bash
wsl --install
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

#### 2. Install a Linux Distribution

Install a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu) in WSL:

```bash
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

To list available distributions:

```bash
wsl --list --online
```

Install your preferred distribution:

```bash
wsl --install -d <distribution-name>
```

#### 3. Installing the Iosevka Font

The Iosevka Term Nerd Font is required for terminal emulators in this setup. On Windows, this installation must be done manually.

1. Download the Iosevka font from its official site or from [Nerd Fonts GitHub](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).
2. Extract the archive and locate the font files (`.ttf` or `.otf`).
3. Right-click each font file and select "Install for all users" to install the font system-wide.

#### 4. Launch and Configure the Distribution

Open the installed distribution to complete setup. Update it with:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

#### 5. Install a Terminal Emulator

Choose and install one of the following terminal emulators:

- **Alacritty**: [Download from GitHub Releases](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases) and place `alacritty.exe` in your `PATH`.
- **WezTerm**: [Download and Install](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/installation.html) and create an environment variable called `HOME` that resolves to `C:\Users\your-username`.
- **Kitty**: [Download and Install](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/#get-the-app).

#### 6. Configuration Transfer for Terminal Emulators

Using PowerShell:

**Alacritty Configuration**

```powershell
mkdir %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\alacritty
cp alacritty.toml %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\alacritty\alacritty.toml

# Uncomment in alacritty.toml

#[shell]
#program = "wsl.exe"
#args = ["--cd","~"]
```

**WezTerm Configuration**

```powershell
cp .wezterm.lua %userprofile%

# Uncomment for Windows settings

# config.default_domain = 'WSL:Ubuntu'

# config.front_end = "WebGpu"
# config.max_fps = 120
```

**If WezTerm doesn't take the initial configuration**

- Create a `wezterm` folder in `C:\User\your-username\.config`
- Copy `.wezterm.lua` into a `wezterm.lua` file inside the previous directory
- Start WezTerm again

**Kitty Configuration**

```powershell
cp -r GentlemanKitty/* %userprofile%\.config\kitty
```

#### 7. Install Chocolatey and win32yank

**Chocolatey** is a package manager for Windows that simplifies the installation of software.

**To install Chocolatey:**

- Open **PowerShell** as an administrator.
- Run the following command:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; `
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = `
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; `
iwr https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex
```

**To install win32yank:**

- After installing Chocolatey, run:

```powershell
choco install win32yank
```

**Note:** `win32yank` is required for clipboard integration in Neovim when using WSL.

    - If no window manager is chosen, you may need to adjust your shell configuration files to prevent automatic launching of a window manager.

#### 9. Configure Neovim

- To install and configure Neovim, follow these steps:

  ```bash
  brew install nvim node npm git gcc fzf fd ripgrep coreutils bat curl lazygit

  # Neovim configuration
  mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim
  cp -r GentlemanNvim/nvim/* ~/.config/nvim/
  ```

- **Manual Obsidian Configuration**

  To set up your Obsidian vault path in Neovim, follow these steps:

  1. **Create the directory for your Obsidian notes** (replace `/path/to/your/notes` with the actual path youâ€™d like to use):

     ```bash
     mkdir -p /path/to/your/notes
     ```

  2. **Inside the notes directory, create a `templates` folder** to store any templates you plan to use:

     ```bash
     mkdir -p /path/to/your/notes/templates
     ```

  3. **Open the `obsidian.lua` file** to configure the vault path:

     ```bash
     nano ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/obsidian.lua
     ```

     Alternatively, use Neovim:

     ```bash
     nvim ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/obsidian.lua
     ```

  4. **Find the line** that contains:

     ```lua
     path = "/your/notes/path",
     ```

  5. **Replace `"/your/notes/path"`** with the path you created for your notes, for example:

     ```lua
     path = "/path/to/your/notes",
     ```

  6. **Save and close** the file:
     - In `nano`, press `Ctrl + O` to save and `Ctrl + X` to exit.
     - In `nvim`, type `:wq` and press `Enter` to save and close.

#### 10. Set the Default Shell

Before setting your default shell, make sure itâ€™s registered in the `/etc/shells` file. This allows the system to recognize it as a valid default shell option.

1. Check if your chosen shell (e.g., `fish`, `zsh`, or `nu`) is already registered in `/etc/shells` by running:

   ```bash
   cat /etc/shells
   ```

2. If your shell isnâ€™t listed, add it manually. For example, to add `fish`, use:

   ```bash
   echo "$(which fish)" | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
   ```

   For `nushell`, you might need to add:

   ```bash
   echo "$(which nu)" | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
   ```

3. Now, set the default shell by replacing `<shell-name>` with the name of your shell (like `fish`, `zsh`, or `nu`):

   ```bash
   chsh -s $(which <shell-name>)
   ```

#### 11. Restart the Shell or Computer

- Close and reopen your terminal, or restart your computer or WSL instance for the changes to take effect.

You're done! You have manually configured your development environment following the Gentleman.Dots script. Enjoy your new environment!

**Note:** If you encounter any problems during configuration, consult the official documentation of the tools or seek help online.

**I hope this guide has been helpful!**

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to reach out to the Gentleman.Dots community or consult the project's documentation.
